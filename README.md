# awootton.github.io

A personal space, presently in 2D. See index.html for the actual content of this project because it's the source of [wootton.us](http://wootton.us) - my personal page.

Not really suitable for contributors but the way I do it is to edit in eclipse OR use a terminal window to cd to the folder and ./python_server.sh
and then, in chrome, http://localhost:8001/ and edit the pages and scripts in chrome.
